	    <h3>The Short-time Cepstrum</h3>
<p>In the source-filter model of speech processing (shown in Figure 1), speech is produced by exciting
a time-varying filter. The excitation generated by the source may be either periodic (in the case of 
voiced sounds) or noise-like (in the case of unvoiced sounds). Thus the speech signal is produced 
by convolving the excitation signal by the response of the filter.</p>

</table>
</center>
<br>
<p>
We know that convolution of two signals in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the 
spectral domain. Since in the speech signal, the source and filter are convolutionally combined, they
cannot be separated by normal linear filtering techniques. To do so, one would in addition to the 
speech signal, need to know either the source or the filter. Short-time spectral analysis of speech 
signals will generally show the magnitude response of the filter overridden by pitch harmonics when the
duration of the analysis window is more than a pitch period.
</p>

<p>
Homomorphic signal processing provides us with techniques that can separate the source and filter to 
some extent. It does so by processing the signal in the cepstral domain.The word cepstral is derived
from cepstrum which in turn is derived  by reversing the order of the first four letters of the term
spectrum. In the cepstral domain, the signal components are additive, easily allowing for the use of
linear filtering techniques 
</p>

<p>
To illustrate the process of computing the cepstrum, consider a speech signal \(s(n)\) produced by
exciting a filter \(h(n)\) be \(e(n)\), i.e., 
$$
s(n)=h(n)*e(n).
$$

Let \(S(\omega)\), \(H(\omega)\) and \(E(\omega)\) be the Fourier transforms corresponding to 
\(s(n)\), \(h(n)\) and \(e(n)\) respectively. Then
$$
S(\omega)=H(\omega)E(\omega).
$$
By applying the logarithmic operator, the multiplication operation can represented in terms
of addition,
$$
\log S(\omega) = \log H(\omega) + \log E(\omega)
$$

Applying the Fourier transform (or the inverse Fourier transform), we obtain
$$
c_S(n)=c_H(n)*c_E(n)
$$
where \(c_S(n)\), \(c_H(n)\) and \(c_E(n)\) are the Fourier transforms (or the inverse Fourier transforms)
of \(\log S(\omega)\), \(\log H(\omega)\) and \(\log E(\omega)\) respectively and are the corresponding
cepstral sequences. The dimension in the cepstrum domain is of time and is referred to as 'quefrency'.
Linear filtering techniques can now be applied in the cepstrum domain and the inverse Fourier transform 
(or the Fourier transform) can be applied to obtain the corresponding spectrum. 
</p>
<p>
Since \(\log S(\omega)\) is complex, the computed cepstrum is referred to as the complex cepstrum.  Since
\(S(\omega)\) is complex, it can be represented as
$$
S(\omega)=|S(\omega)|e^{j \theta (\omega)}.
$$
Application of the logarithmic operator yields
$$
\log S(\omega)=\log |S(\omega)|+j\theta (\omega).
$$
The cepstrum can also be computed from the real part of \(\log S(\omega)\) in which case the cepstrum is 
referred to as the real cepstrum. Considering only the real part,
\begin{eqnarray}
\mbox{real} \{\log S(\omega)\} & = & \log |S(\omega)|,\\
								 & = & \log |H(\omega) E(\omega)| \\
								 & = & \log |H(\omega)| + \log|E(\omega)|.
\end{eqnarray}

<h3>Application of the Cepstrum to Speech Analysis</h3>
<p>Figure 2 shows a segment of voiced speech of duration of 25 ms. Its magnitude log spectrum computed using
a 1024-point FFT and the corresponding real cepstrum are shown in Figure 3. The low quefrency regions in the 
cepstrum is dominated
by the filter and the higher quefrency regions are dominated by the excitation source. This can be easily
verified by liftering the spectrum (filtering operation in the cepstrum domain). Figure 4 shows the 
low-quefrency liftered cepstrum and the corresponding spectrum. It can be seen that the spectral characteristics
corresponding to the filter (vocal-tract system) can be clearly observed. Similarily Figure 5 shows the
high quefrency liftered cepstrum with the corresponding spectrum. The spectrum shows the periodic structure that 
normally overrides the speech spectrum. </p>
