<li>For a given sound-unit, the formant frequency values varies
slightly across different speakers. This illustrates the differences in the vocal tract system characteristics across speakers, inspite of their articulation and perception as the same sound. This observation is useful to discriminate speakers. But the formant frequencies of a given sound unit are more similar across different speakers, than across sound units within the same speaker.
