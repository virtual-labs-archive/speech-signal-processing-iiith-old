The objective of this analysis-by-synthesis experiment is to break down the speech signal into different components such as the excitation source information (pitch and gain) and vocal tract system information (formants).
The various components derived by analysis of the speech signal is used to resynthesise the speech signal.
<!--The use of analysis-by-synthesis framework is illustrated for prosody (pitch and duration) modification. -->

	<p>From a signal processing standpoint, it is very useful to think of speech
production in terms of a model, as in Figure 1.
The model shown is the simplest of its kind,
but it includes all the principal components.
The excitations for voiced and unvoiced speech are represented by an
impulse train and white noise generator, respectively.
The pitch of voiced speech is controlled by the spacing between
impulses, \(T_p\), and
the amplitude (volume) of the excitation is controlled by the gain factor \(G\).
As the acoustical excitation travels from its source (vocal cords,
or a constriction), the shape of the vocal tract alters the spectral
content of the signal.
The most prominent effect is the formation of resonances, which
intensifies the signal energy at certain frequencies (called formants).
As we learned in the Digital Filter Design lab, the amplification of certain
frequencies may be achieved with a linear filter by an appropriate
placement of poles in the transfer function.
This is why the filter in our speech model utilizes an all-pole LTI filter.
A more accurate model might include a few zeros in the transfer function,
but if the order of the filter is chosen appropriately, the all-pole model
is sufficient.
The primary reason for using the all-pole model is the distinct computational
advantage in calculating the filter coefficients, as will be discussed
shortly.Recall that the transfer function of an all-pole filter has the form
          $$V(z)=\frac{1}{1Ã¢Ë†â€™\sum_{k=1}^{P} a_k z^Ã¢Ë†â€™k} \qquad(1)$$,
where \(P\) is the order of the filter.

This is an IIR filter that may be implemented with a recursive difference equation.
With the input \(G x(n)\), the speech signal \(s(n)\) may be written as
			
          $$ s(n)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{P} a_k s(nÃ¢Ë†â€™k)+G x(n) \qquad (2)$$</p>

 </tr>
</tbody><caption align="bottom"><b>Figure 1. </b><em>Impulse+noise model of speech production</em> </caption> 
 </table> 
 <br/>        
 <p> Keep in mind that the filter coefficients will change continuously as
the shape of the vocal tract changes, but speech segments of an
appropriately small length may be approximated by a time-invariant model.
This speech model is used in a variety of speech processing applications,
including methods of speech recognition, speech coding for transmission,
and speech synthesis.
Each of these applications of the model involves dividing the speech signal
into short segments, over which the filter coefficients are almost constant.
For example, in speech transmission the bit rate can be significantly
reduced by dividing the signal up into segments, computing and sending
the model parameters for each segment (filter coefficients, gain, etc.),
and re-synthesizing the signal at the receiving end, using a model
similar to Figure 1.
Most telephone systems use some form of this approach.
Another example is speech recognition.
Most recognition methods involve comparisons between short
segments of the speech signals, and the filter coefficients of this model
are often used in computing the Ã¢â‚¬Å“difference" between segments.</p>


<h3>Speech Coding and Synthesis</h3>
<p>One very effective application of LPC is the compression
of speech signals.
For example, an LPC vocoder (voice-coder) is a system used in
many telephone systems to reduce the bit rate for the transmission of speech.
This system has two overall components:
an analysis section which computes signal
parameters (gain, filter coefficients, etc.), and a synthesis section which
reconstructs the speech signal after transmission. Since we have introduced the speech model,
and the estimation of LPC coefficients,
we now have all the tools necessary to implement a simple vocoder.
First, in the analysis section,
the original speech signal will be split into short time frames.
For each frame, we will compute the signal energy, the LPC coefficients,
and determine whether the segment is voiced or unvoiced.	</p>

<li><p>The LP residual signal used as excitation, there are large error values at regular intervals within voiced regions of speech. These are the instants of glottal closure at which the vocal tract system is excited. Hence the LP residual signal can be approximated to the excitation source signal.</p></li><br/><p></p>

<li><p>Resynthesis of the speech signal using the LP residual (excitation source) and the LPCs (vocal tract system) gives back the original speech signal. But the synthesized waveform doesn't exactly corresponds to original speech signal waveform. This is because of the different orders of LP analysis used to generate residual signal and synthesize speech signal.</p></li><br/><p></p>

<li><p>The excitation source signal can be approximated by a train of impulses, but the quality of synthesized speech is poor though the message can be inferred easily.</p></li><br/><p></p>

<li><p>The resynthesised speech signal sounds like a whispered speech when a random noise signal is used as the excitation source.</p></li><br/><p></p>

<li><p>It can be seen that an LP order of as low as 3 can capture significant information on the message front even when an impulse train or random noise is used as the excitation. The quality of speech improves with the increase in the LP order. But using the original LP residual signal gives very good synthesis even for the 3rd order LP coefficients.</p></li><br/>
