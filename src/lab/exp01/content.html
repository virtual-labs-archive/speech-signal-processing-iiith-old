<p>The main objective of this experiment is to make the student understand and appreciate the difficulties in automating the task of speech signal-to-symbol transformation. The students are expected to understand terms such as phones, phonemes, syllables, transliteration, pitch or fundamental frequency, quasi-periodicity. The student should gain a good understanding of the speech signal by visual inspection. Given a speech waveform one should be able to discriminate between silence and speech, voiced speech and unvoiced speech. The student should be able to draw the speech waveform for a given word with appropriate time durations and relative amplitudes of the constituent phones.</p>

<p>Write down a sentence in any Indian language, preferably your native  language, on a piece of paper or your note book. Also, write down the sentence in English the way you would probably write it if you were writing a mail to your friend in your language</p>
<p>Eg: Let us consider a sentence in Hindi:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Utt #1: भारत हमारा देश है</p>
<p>Transliteration in English: Bharat hamara desh hai</p>
<p>or in Telugu: భారత్ హమారా దేశ్ హై </p>
<!--<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Utt #2: శ్రీ ఎమ్ వెన్కయ్య నాయ్దు&nbsp; చెప్పెరు</p>-->
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Utt #2: శ్రీ ఎం వెంకయ్య నాయుడు చెప్పెరు </p>
<p>Transliteration in English: Shri M. Venkaiahnaidu chepperu</p>
<h2>Transliteration</h2>
<p>Transliteration is the process of writing one language using the script of another language. For example, the Hindi utterance considered earlier is also written in English alphabets. The primary advantage of writing Hindi or any other Indian languages in English is that one can read it on a computer even if fonts for Devanagari (Hindi or Sanskrit script) or other Indian languages are not installed or rendered properly. Also, it is easier to write and debug programs using these English alphabets, till the time Indian language support for computers becomes widespread. In such a scenario, all softwares on our computer will be in our native script and one can write programs using our native script instead of English.</p>
<p>The transliteration of the Hindi utterance given above (written using English alphabets or Latin script) uses a convention to write down Hindi alphabets in English. Eg. 'Bha' is used for 'भा'. Somebody else may write it as 'Bhaa' or 'BhA' or 'bhaa' or 'bhA' so that the long vowel 'aa' or 'A' can be easily discriminated from its short vowel 'a'.
Also note that 'bh' is used to denote the aspirated sound so as to discriminate from its unaspirated counterpart 'b'.
It is fine as long as it does not conflict with any other alphabet which may lead to ambiguity.
The point here is that, there is a need for a common rule or convention, if followed by every one, makes life easier and avoids confusion during discussions or when programs are shared. <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITRANS>ITRANS</a> code is one such convention used to write Indian language alphabets in English.</p>
<p>Transliteration in English: Bharat hamara desh hai</p>
<p>Transliteration in ITRANS: sri em ve.nkayyanayudu chepperu</p>

<h2>Recording and studying the speech signal</h2>
<p>Record a speech utterance using any sound recording utility at a sampling rate of 8 kHz or 16 kHz, at 16 bits per sample.
A recording utility is provided in the experiment section as part of this virtual lab, which by default records records at 8 kHz and 16 bits per sample.
Some of the other recording utilities that can be used for offline recording are <a href="http://www.speech.kth.se/wavesurfer/index.html">wavesurfer</a>, <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">audacity</a> or <a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/">praat</a>, which can be freely downloaded from the net.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the sound card is configured properly on your machine and you are able to record and playback audio signals. It is also assumed that Sun Java 6 or above and its corresponding browser plugin is installed.
See the software prerequesites on the main page of this virtual lab.
</p>

<p>Display the recorded speech signal using any waveform analysis utility.
Zoom in, select and listen to shorter segments of the speech waveform.
Try to identify regions of speech and nonspeech (silence) by visual inspection.</p>
<!--
<h2>Deriving the syllable-like units from English transcription</h2>
<p>Split the utterance (text in ITRANS code) into syllable-like units. That is the ITRANS code text representation of the utterance is divided into subword units such as syllable-like units (text to symbol transformation, i.e., sentence to subword units). Reasons for choosing syllable-like units as symbols as against phonemes (consonants or vowels (C or V)) are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) It is much harder to segment the speech data into phonemes as compared to syllable-like units.<br>
(2) Due to coarticulation the effect of consonants is observed in the adjacent vowels.<br>
(3) A character in an Indian language scripts is close to a syllable, and is typically one of the forms: V, CV, CCV, CVC, CCVC and CVCC, where C is a consonant and V is a vowel.</p>
<p>Utterance in ITRANS code: sri ve.nkayyanayudu chepperu</p>
<p>Syllable-like units of the utterance : sri em ve.n ka yya na yu du che ppe ru</p>

<h2>Identifying the boundaries of the syllable-like units in speech waveform</h2>
<p>Manually mark the boundaries of the syllable-like units by listening to the speech file segment by segment. The marked syllable boundaries and the associated waveform are shown in Figure 1. In the derived syllable boundaries some of the syllables present in the transcription are missing and some new syllables are marked. The expected syllable boundaries for a given speech file as per the transcription are shown in Figure 2.</p>

<!-- <h2>Brief Instructions</h2> -->

<h2>Part-1: Learn by pre-segmented examples</h2>
<ul>

<li><p>Select an utterance of your choice from the list of examples provided.</p></li>
<li><p>  Note down the utterance in the native script of the language, and the word-level transliteration of the Indian language utterance using English alphabets.</p></li>
<li><p> Study the subword-level (syllable-level and phoneme-level) transliterations by changing the subword unit.</p></li>
<li><p> Now choose the subword unit as word, and note the list of words and their boundaries given in the table by the side of the speech waveform.</p></li>
<li><p> Use the zoom, select and play buttons to select a portion of the waveform, listen, and verify the boundaries of the subword units given in the table.</p></li>
<li><p> Change the subword unit to syllable and repeat the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p> Change the subword unit to phoneme and repeat the experiment.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Part-2: Segmentation with feedback</h2>
<p>This part of the experiment is very similar to Part-1, except that the word/subword boundaries are not provided.
The student is required to segment the given utterance into the chosen subword units by entering the correct subword boundaries.</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Select an utterance and choose the subword unit as word.</p></li>
<li> <p>Use the zoom, select and play buttons to select a portion of the waveform, listen, and enter the subword boundaries in the table.</p></li>
<li><p> A prompting message pops up if the entered boundary value is in error with the reference markings by more than 20 ms.</p></li>
<li><p> Repeat the experiment by changing the subword unit to syllable.</p></li>
<li> <p>Repeat the experiment by changing the subword unit to phoneme.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Part-3: Segmentation without feedback</h2>
<p>This part of the experiment is similar to the first two parts, but you have to choose your own utterance, transcribe and syllabify the utterance, record the utterance and segment it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Select a language of your choice and type in an utterance of your choice.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify that the utterance you have typed is appearing correctly in the native script and press the done button.</p></li>
<li><p>Now your chosen utterance and its constituent phonemes are displayed. Syllabify the utterance by grouping adjacent phonemes appropriately into syllables of the form \( C^*VC^* \), where \( C \) denotes a consonant, \( V \) denotes a vowel, and \( ^* \) denotes zero or more occurances of the consonant. Click on the 'Done' button.</p></li>
<li><p>Now record the utterance by clicking on the 'Rec' button and then clicking on the 'Stop' button to stop recording. Load the utterance by clicking on the 'Load' button.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the zoom, select and play buttons to select a portion of the waveform, listen, and enter the subword boundaries in the table.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Marking boundaries at the phoneme-level is the most diffcult compared to using larger units such as syllables or words.</p></li><br>
<li><p>It is difficult to mark, listen and perceive unambiguously shorter units of sound such phonemes, as compared to syllables or words.</p></li><br>
<li><p>The boundaries between subword units are fuzzy due to the coarticulation effect.</p></li><br>
<li><p>The spoken form of a speech utterance (especially spontaneous speech) may not always contain all the phonemes used in the written form. But while listening we use the higher-level language and context information to fill in these sounds and perceive the intended word or phrase.</p></li><br>
<li><p>The above observations highlight the complexity of the task involved in speech signal-to-symbol transformation, even for human beings who are endowed with the ability to produce and comprehend natural speech. </p></li><br>
<li><p>Choice of subword unit is one of the important issues in designing an automatic speech signal-to-symbol transformation system.
<br><br> 
Word seems to be a good choice, but the number of words in a language run up to several tens of thousands. Devising a pattern recognition/classification strategy for such a large number of classes is a tough task. Also, collecting a large number of examples for each of the words to be used within a statistical framework is difficult.
<br><br>Syllables are a better option as the number of classes will be in a few hundreds. The context of a sound is inherently captured in the syllable. But the number of classes are still large, and getting enough examples for all possible syllables in a language is difficult.
<br><br>Choice of phoneme as the subword unit makes the design of a system using statistical framework easier, due to the smaller number of classes (a few tens of classes) and the ease of collecting large number of examples for each class.
But handling the variability of phones occuring in different contexts caused by the coarticulation effect is difficult.</p>

<!--
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>Speech transcription is simply speech signal-to-symbol transformation. The choice of symbols is left to the individual. The symbols can be words, syllables or phonemes, which are typically associated with a language.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>If you have never heard a language before, you would try to look for sounds that are present in languages that you already know and try to write down the unknown speech using symbols from a known language.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>This is exactly where innovation begins. One has to invent a new symbol for the sound and give a complete description of the sound in terms of the speech production apparatus, so that anybody can understand, visualize and produce that sound again.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>The symbols for transcription can either be based on auditory perception or the production apparatus or the acoustic signal.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>Symbols based on auditory perception is a bit difficult as it requires a human being to articulate the sounds in terms of what he feels such as soft, loud, hoarse, creaky, high pitch, low pitch, hissy, plosive, etc. A complete set of descriptors based on perception is not available for all known sounds a human can produce.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>Alternatively, one can articulate better as to how a sound is being produced in terms of various articulatory events during the production of speech. This process can be aided by studying the articulatory movements during speech prodcution using man made devices such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, etc.</li>
