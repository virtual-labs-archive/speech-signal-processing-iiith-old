	   Now that we have the basic background material covered, letâ€™s start talking about DSP. The starting point we need to understand is sampling and its effect on the signal of interest. To take an analog signal and convert it to a digital signal, we need to sample the signal using a device called an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The ADC measures the signal at rapid intervals, and these measurements are called samples. It outputs a digital signal proportional to the amplitude of the analog signal at that instant. This scenario can be compared to looking at an object with only a strobe light for illumination. You can see the object only when the strobe light flashes. If the object is not moving, then ...

	    <li>In signal processing and related disciplines, aliasing is an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (or aliases of one another) when sampled. It also refers to the distortion or artifact that results when the signal reconstructed from samples is different from the original continuous signal. </li>
