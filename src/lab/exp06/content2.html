<!--
<p>The main objective of this experiment is to make the student understand and appreciate the difficulties in automating the task of speech signal-to-symbol transformation. The students are expected to understand terms such as phones, phonemes, syllables, transliteration, pitch or fundamental frequency, quasi-periodicity. The student should gain a good understanding of the speech signal by visual inspection. Given a speech waveform one should be able to discriminate between silence and speech, voiced speech and unvoiced speech. The student should be able to draw the speech waveform for a given word with appropriate time durations and relative amplitudes of the constituent phones.</p>

<p>Record speech signal of a sentence in any of the Indian languages, identify and mark by listening, manually, the boundaries of words and subword units (such as syllables and phonemes). Draw on a piece of paper the speech waveform for the first few words of the sentence with appropriate time durations and relative amplitudes of various sounds, clearly marking the various subword boundaries.</p>

        class="content">

<h2>Step 1: Write down a sentence</h2>
<p>Write down a sentence in any Indian language, preferably your native  language, on a piece of paper or your note book. Also, write down the sentence in English the way you would probably write it if you were writing a mail to your friend in your language</p>
<p>Eg: Let us consider a sentence in Hindi:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Utt #1: भारत हमार देश है</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Transliteration in English: Bharat hamara desh hai</p>
<p>or in Telugu:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Utt #2: శ్రీ ఎమ్ వెన్కయ్య నాయ్దు&nbsp; చెప్పెరు</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Transliteration in English: ShrI M. Venkaiahnaidu chepperu</p>
<h2>Step 2: Transliteration</h2>
<p>Transliteration is the process of writing one language using the script of another language. For example, the Hindi utterance considered in Step 1 is also written within brackets in English alphabets. The primary advantage of writing Hindi or any other Indian languages in English is that one can read it on a computer even if fonts for Devanagari (Hindi or Sanskrit script) or other Indian languages are not installed or rendered properly on our machine. Also, it is easier to write and debug programs using these English alphabets, till the time Indian language support for computers becomes widespread. In such a scenario, all softwares on our computer wiil be in our native script and one can write programs using our native script instead of English.</p>
<p>The transliteration of the Hindi utterance given in Step 1 (written using English alphabets or Latin script) uses a convention to write down Hindi alphabets in English. Eg. Bhaa is used for भा. Somebody else may write it as bhaa or BhA or bhA . The point here is that, there is a need for a common rule or convention, if followed by every one make life easier and avoids confusion during discussions or when programs are shared. ITRANS code is one such convention used to write Indian language alphabets in English.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Transliteration in English: Bharat hamara desh hai</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">ITRANS code: sri em ve.nkayyanayudu chepperu</p>

<h2>Step 3: Record the speech signal</h2>
<p>We assume that sound is configured properly on your machine and you are able to playback audio files through headphones or speakers. It is also assumed that recording of sound using a microphone works perfectly fine on the system.</p>
<p>Record a speech utterance using wavesurfer or any other utility at a sampling rate of 16 kHz and at 16 bits per sample.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Displaying the speech data</h2>
<p>Display the given speech data file using the utility ”wavesurfer”.</p>
<h2>Step 5: Transcription into known language</h2>
<p>Play the speech file using ”wavesurfer”</p>
<p>By listening to the speech, write the utterance into the known (native) language.</p>
<h2>Step 6: Transcription into English using ITRANS code tables</h2>
<p>Transcribe the utterance into English using ITRANS code tables.</p>
<p>ITRANS code: sri em ve.nkayyanayudu chepperu</p>
<p>ITRANS code is the common transliteration code for Indian languages. Using these ITRANS code tables, any Indian language script can be transcribed into English. For each of the Indian language a separate ITRANS code table is used to transcribe the script from the given language into English.</p>
<h2>Step 7: Deriving the syllable-like units from English transcription</h2>
<p>Split the utterance (text in ITRANS code) into syllable-like units. That is the ITRANS code text representation of the utterance is divided into subword units such as syllable-like units (text to symbol transformation, i.e., sentence to subword units). Here syllable-like units are the symbols corresponds to the segments of the speech signal.<br>Reasons for choosing the syllable-like units as symbols against to phonemes (consonants or vowels (C or V)):</p>

<p>(1) It is very difficult to segment the speech data into phonemes.<br>(2) Due to coarticulation the effect of consonants is observed in the adjacent vowels.<br>(3) A character in an Indian language scripts is close to a syllable, and is typically one of the forms: V, CV, CCV, CVC, CCVC and CVCC, where C is a consonant and V is a vowel.</p>
<p>Utterance in ITRANS code: sri ve.nkayyanayudu chepperu</p>
<p>Syllable-like units of the utterance : sri em ve.n ka yya na yu du che ppe ru</p>
<h2>Step 8: Identifying the boundaries of the syllablelike units in speech waveform</h2>
<p>Manually mark the boundaries of the syllable-like units by listening to the speech file segment by segment. The marked syllable boundaries and the associated waveform are shown in Figure 2. In the derived syllable boundaries some of the syllables present in the transcription are missing and some new syllables are marked. The expected syllable boundaries for a given speech file as per the transcription are shown in Figure 3.</p>

<li>
<h3>Even the word boundaries can also be marked easily most of the times.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>While marking the boundaries of the syllables in a polysyllabic word a great difficulty is observed.</h3>

<li>
<h3>Due to coarticulation effect, it is difficult to listen the particular syllable without the influence of the adjacent syllables in a polysyllabic word.</h3>

</li>
<li>
<h3>In particular marking the boundaries of a syllable with semivowels found to be difficult.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>While listening to the segments of the speech data file, we are not able to perceive (completely missing) some syllables. But at the same time we can able to perceive a word clearly, where the syllables (missing) are present.</h3>

<h3>These observations show the complexity of the task involved in speech signal-to-symbol transformation, even for human beings who are endowed with the ability to produce and comprehend natural speech.</h3>

          class="content">
<h3>Q. What is transcription or speech transcription?</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>Speech transcription is simply speech signal-to-symbol transformation. The choice of symbols is left to the individual. The symbols can be words, syllables or phonemes, which are typically associated with a language.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Q. How would you transcribe speech of an unknown language?</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>If you have never heard a language before, you would try to look for sounds that are present in languages that you already know and try to write down the unknown speech using symbols from a known language.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Q. How would you handle new sounds in an unknown language which are not present in any of your known languages?</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>This is exactly where innovation begins. One has to invent a new symbol for the sound and give a complete description of the sound in terms of the speech production apparatus, so that anybody can understand, visualize and produce that sound again.</li>

</ol>
<h3>Q. What choices does one have for symbols other than words, syllables or phonemes?</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>The symbols for transcription can either be based on auditory perception or the production apparatus or the acoustic signal.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Q. What symbols can one choose based on auditory perception?</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>Symbols based on auditory perception is a bit difficult as it requires a human being to articulate the sounds in terms of what he feels such as soft, loud, hoarse, creaky, high pitch, low pitch, hissy, plosive, etc. A complete set of descriptors based on perception is not available for all known sounds a human can produce.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Q. What symbols can one choose based on production mechanism or apparatus?</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>Alternatively, one can articulate better as to how a sound is being produced in terms of various articulatory events during the production of speech. This process can be aided by studying the articulatory movements during speech prodcution using man made devices such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, etc.</li>

</ol>
<h3>Q. What is a phoneme?</h3>
<h3>Q. What is an allophone?</h3>
<h3>Q. What is the difference between terms phonetic and phonemic?</h3>
<h3>Q. What is a syllable?</h3>
<h3>Q. What is transliteration?</h3>
<h3>Q. What is ITRANS code?</h3>
<h3>Q. How to record sound?</h3>
