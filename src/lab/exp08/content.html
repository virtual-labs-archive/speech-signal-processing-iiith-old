<h3>Source-system modeling of speech signals using LP analysis</h3>
</p>
<p>
The vocal tract system can be modeled as a time-varying all-pole filter using segmental analysis.
The segmental analysis corresponds to the processing of speech as short (10-30 ms) overlapped (5-15 ms) windows.
The vocal tract system is assumed to be stationary within the window and is modeled as an all-pole filter of order \( p \) using linear prediction (LP) analysis.
The LP analysis works on the principle that a sample value in a correlated, stationary sequence can be predicted as a linear weighted sum of the past few (\( p \)) samples.
If \( s(n) \) denotes a sequence of speech samples, then the predicted value at the time instant \( n \) is given by
$$ \hat{s}(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{p}{a_k~s(n-k)} \qquad (1) $$
where \( \{a_k\},~k=1,2,...,p \) is the set of linear predictor coefficients (LPC) and \(p\) is the order of the LP filter. 
The error at time \(n\) and the sum of squared errors \( E \) are given by
$$ r(n)~=~s(n)~-~\hat{s}(n) \qquad(2)$$
$$ E=~\sum_{n}{r^2(n)} \qquad(3) $$
The cost function \( E \) is minimized with respect to \( \{a_i\},~i=1,2,...,p \) over the interval \( {-\infty}~{\leq}~n~{\leq}~{\infty} \) (autocorrelation formulation) as,
$$ {\partial{E}}/{\partial{a_i}}~=~0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1~{\leq}~i~{\leq}~p \qquad(4)$$
This minimization leads to a set of normal equations,
$$ \sum_{k=1}^{p}{a_k~R(i-k)} = -R(i)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1~{\leq}~i~{\leq}~p \qquad(5)$$
where 
$$ R(i) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}s(n)~s(n+i)~~~~~~~~~~-{\infty}~{\leq}~i~{\leq}~{\infty} \qquad(6) $$
is the autocorrelation sequence. The solution of these normal equations gives the values of the predictor coefficients \( \{a_k\},~k=1,2,...,p \).
The error signal \( r(n) \) obtained by inverse filtering the speech signal
is referred to as the LP <i>residual</i>.
The smooth variations (highly correlated) in the speech signal are captured by the LPCs and are attributed to the vocal tract characteristics.
The complex poles of the LP filter occur as conjugate pairs, and each pair represents a resonator cavity, with a maximum response at a frequency (called as <i>resonant frequency</i>) where the poles are located on the z-plane.
The vocal tract can be considered as a cascade of resonator cavities with different shapes and sizes.
The resonant frequencies of these cavities are referred to as <i>formants</i>.
The LP residual signal has large error values at regular intervals and can be attributed to the periodic impulses of excitation.
Hence the LP residual is a good approximation to the excitation source signal and can be used further to extract the excitation source characteristics.
A segment of voiced speech (windowed), frequency response of the inverse filter and the corresponding LP residual are shown in Figure 1.

<h2>Short time spectrum, LP spectrum and Inverse spectrum</h2>
<p>
The short-time spectrum consists of range of frequencies (magnitude and
phase components) that are present in a small segment (10-30 ms) of a
signal. 
An inverse spectrum \(A(j\omega)\) is an all-zero model derived from \(A(z)\). 
The LP spectrum is an all-pole model given by \(\frac{1}{A(j\omega)}\).
The LP spectrum can approximate the envelope of the short-time spectrum depending on the choice of LP order.
The gross envelope is captured at low LP orders such as 1 or 3.
The short-time spectral envelope is finely matched as the LP order increases.
One of the main issues in LP analysis is the choice of appropriate LP order.
Figures 2 and 3 show the short-time spectrum, LP spectrum and the inverse LP spectrum for a segment of voiced (/a/) and unvoiced speech (/s/) respectively.

<li><p>Short time spectrum gives both source and system information. The
envelope of the spectrum gives system information (i.e., resonances in
terms of formant frequencies) and spectral ripples (fine variations)
give source information (i.e., pitch harmonics). It is a real and even
function of ω.</p> </li>
<li><p>The linear prediction (LP) analysis models the vocal tract
system. LP spectrum is observed to be an envelope of short time spectrum
(smoothed version of short time spectrum) and the peaks in LP spectrum
indicate the formant frequencies (resonances) of the vocal tract
system. With observation it is evident that the LP spectrum is derived
from an all-pole filter.</p> </li>
<li><p>The inverse spectrum is observed to be reciprocal of the LP
spectrum. Therefore, we can observe the valleys corresponding to the peaks
in LP spectrum. It is represented by an all-zero filter.</p></li>
<li><p>For voiced speech segment its LP residual is observed to be
periodic. In LP residual signal, peak amplitudes refers to closure of
vocal folds (glottal closure), where the prediction is poor therefore
its results as maximum error. </p><br>
</li>
<li><p>The periodicity in LP residual also indicate the pitch
information.</p></li>
<li><p>LP residual is a result of passing the speech signal through
inverse filter (i.e., removing the vocal tract information). This is
also considered to be the excitation signal (source information).</p></li>
<li><p>LP residual for unvoiced speech segment looks like random noise.
This is because the unvoiced speech signal has no periodicity and looks like random
noise (no relations among the samples). </p></li>
<li><p>The basic property of the autocorrelation function (even
symmetry) is evident in all (voiced/unvoiced speech and LP residual
signals) the plots. </p><br>
</li>
<li><p>The samples in a voiced speech segment are highly correlated,
therefore we will observe the peaks other than center are also
prominent. As voiced speech is periodic, it is inherited in its
autocorrelation function also.</p> <br>
</li>
<li><p>In LP residual, the correlation among the samples is less,
therefore its autocorrelation function contains the peaks at pitch
rate. Hence autocorrelation function of a LP residual is useful for
pitch computation. </p><br>
</li>
<li><p>The autocorrelation function of an unvoiced speech segment shows
a major peak at the center and other peaks are not significant, since
unvoiced speech signal appears like random signal.</p></li>
<li><p>The autocorrelation function for the LP residual of an unvoiced
speech segment shows a dominant peak at the center and no other peaks
in rest of the portion. This is because, unvoiced speech itself looks
like random (no correlation among the samples) and its residual
reflects still random.</p><br>
</li>
<li><p>Glottal pulse shape shows the change in volume of air. It is also
referred to as glottal volume velocity. </p><br>
</li>
<li><p>From the glottal pulse waveform, it is observed that volume of
air and its pressure will be maximum at the instant of closure.
Following this is the opening of the vocal folds, as a result of which
the air pressure decreases.</p></li>
<li><p>LP order determines to some extent the accuracy with which speech
production mechanism is modeled. </p><br>
</li>
<li><p>LP analysis uses an all-pole model to characterize the vocal tract system
by capturing the resonances with spectrum and source information with LP
residual (inverse filter i.e., all-zero filter).</p> <br>
</li>
<li><p>LP order determines the number of resonances that can be captured
by
the model. The maximum number of resonances captured by the model with
LP order <span class="MATH">P</span> is P/2.</p> <br>
</li>
<li><p>The length of the vocal tract from glottis to lips is
approximately 17
cm. This can generate four to five prominent resonances in 0-4 KHz
range. These resonances can be captured with the LP model of order 10.
We also should take care of radiation and windowing effects. Therefore
with LP order 10-14 we can model the system by capturing required
resonances.&nbsp;</p> </li>
<li><p>System with LP order more than 14 will introduce the spurious
resonances, which leads improper representation of the vocal tract
system.</p></li>
<!--
<li>Normalized error for voiced speech signal reduces as the LP order
is varied from 0 to 15, since the vocal tract system (speech production
mechanism) is modeled more accurately as LP order varying from 0 to
15.&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>P=0, no approximation, therefore maximum error&nbsp;</li>
<li>P=1, only one coefficient used for prediction, therefore error
is slightly less compared to that of P=0&nbsp;</li>
<li>P=10, model correctly approximates the resonances of the vocal
tract system, which leads to minimum error&nbsp;</li>
<li>P ≥ 10
also results the correct modeling of the vocal tract system, which
leads to similar error as that of model with P=10&nbsp;</li>
<li>For unvoiced speech signal, as the signal and residual energies
remains reasonable same, change in error as function of LP order is
relatively insensitive. Unvoiced speech signal itself appears like
random noise, therefore the prediction will remains poor even though if
we increase the LP order. Therefore both unvoiced speech signal and its
LP residual appears like noise, hence the normalized error for unvoiced
speech signal won't depend on the LP order.</li>
