# Experiment	Project	Documentation

# Introduction

This		document	captures	the	technical	details	related	to	the	experiment	development.

# Project

**Domain	Name**	: Computer	Science	&	Engineering

**Lab	Name**	: Speech Signal Processing

**Experiment	Name**	: Linear Prediction Analysis of Speech 

In Speech Processing , the linear predictive coding works on the principle that a sample value in a correlated, stationary sequence can be predicted as a linear weighted sum of the past few samples. The prediction of current sample as a linear combination of past p samples form the basis of linear prediction analysis where p is the order of prediction.

# Purpose	of	the	project

The purpose of the project is to convert the **Linear Prediction Analysis of Speech** experiment simulaon from
**Java** 	to		 **Javascript**.

# Process	Followed	to	convert	the	experiment

1. Understanding	the	assigned	experiment	Java	simulation
2. Understanding	the	experiment	concept
3. Re-implement	the	same	in	javascript

# Value	Added	by	our	Project

1. It	would	be	beneficial	for	engineering	students. 
2. Highly beneficial for Tier 	2	 and Tier 	3	 college students who can use this to learn and
    understand	the	concept	of	Linear predictive Analysis of Speech.


# Risks	and	Challenges

Lack of sound analysis libraries in JavaScript poses major challenge to precisely implement Linear Predictive Algorithm purely on JavaScript. However, the simulation gives a rough estimate about the linear predictive coding and how the redundancy in voiced and unvoiced sound signals vary. 

# Issues	:
Due to functional limitations, the vocal tract parameter cannot be analyzed form this experiment. Users are requested to refer other online source for more detailed information.
